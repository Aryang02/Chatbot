Trial:Neuron coverage is a metric that measures the number of unique activated neurons in a DNN for a given set of test inputs, divided by the total number of neurons in the DNN.

Trial:DeepXplore is the first whitebox framework for systematically testing DNNs.

Trial:Neuron coverage is a measure of the number of unique activated neurons in a neural network for a given set of input data. It is defined as the ratio of the number of activated neurons to the total number of neurons in the network.

Trial:Neuron coverage is a metric used to measure the completeness of a test suite for a deep neural network (DNN). It is defined as the number of unique neurons that are activated by a set of test inputs divided by the total number of neurons in the DNN. A higher neuron coverage indicates that the test suite is more likely to uncover errors in the DNN.

Trial:Neuron coverage is a metric that measures the number of unique activated neurons in a neural network for a given input. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of activated neurons to the total number of neurons in the network. Neuron coverage is a useful metric for evaluating the comprehensiveness of a test set, as it provides an indication of how well the test set exercises the different rules learned by the network.

Trial:DeepXplore is the first whitebox framework for systematically testing DNNs. It introduces a new metric, neuron coverage, measuring how many rules of a DNN are exercised by a set of inputs. DeepXplore performs gradient ascent to solve a joint optimization problem that maximizes neuron coverage and the number of potentially erroneous behaviors. DeepXplore is able to find thousands of erroneous behaviors in 15 state-of-the-art DNNs trained on five real-world datasets.

Trial:This paper presents DeepXplore, a novel approach for generating test inputs for deep neural networks (DNNs) that aims to maximize neuron coverage while satisfying domain-specific constraints. The authors argue that neuron coverage is a better metric for measuring the comprehensiveness of DNN testing than traditional code coverage, as it captures the activation of individual neurons within the network. They demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepXplore in finding erroneous behaviors in a variety of DNNs, including image classifiers, malware detectors, and self-driving systems. The paper also provides a detailed description of the DeepXplore algorithm, which uses a gradient-based approach to iteratively modify test inputs to maximize neuron coverage while satisfying domain-specific constraints.

Trial:DNNs are inspired by the human brain. They have millions of interconnected neurons, and they are known for their amazing ability to automatically identify and extract relevant high-level features from raw input without human guidance, besides labeled training data.

Trial:The metamorphosis is about a man who transforms into a giant insect. The story is a metaphor for the alienation and dehumanization of the individual in modern society.

Trial:The Metamorphosis is a novella by Franz Kafka, first published in 1915. It tells the story of Gregor Samsa, a young man who wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into a large insect. Gregor's family is horrified by his transformation, and he is soon isolated from them. He spends his days in his room, contemplating his new life and the meaning of his existence. The Metamorphosis is a complex and multi-layered work that has been interpreted in many different ways. It is often seen as a metaphor for the alienation and isolation of modern life, or as a parable about the human condition.
